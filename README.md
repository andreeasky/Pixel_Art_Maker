# Pixel Art Maker


Pixel Art Maker project for the "Introduction to Programming" Nanodegree:



The user can create a canvas of any (reasonable) size. This project is done in JavaScript. 


- Entering whole numbers in the "Height" and "Width" fields, and submitting the form, causes an empty grid to appear on the page.

- The user can color the pixels in the grid.

- Choosing a color from the color selector and clicking on a grid square causes that grid square (and only that square) to change color.

- Event listeners are properly added to the grid squares (and not to the border or the table itself).

- The user can reset the grid to a blank state.

- If there are already colored squares in the grid, clicking the Submit button clears them out.
